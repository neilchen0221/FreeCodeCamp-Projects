            Professional basketball player Kyrie Irving helped the Cleveland Cavaliers win their first NBA championship
            before moving on to star for the Boston Celtics.
          </p>
          <h2>Who Is Kyrie Irving?</h2>
          <p>
            Born in 1992 in Melbourne, Australia, Kyrie Irving became a high school basketball star in New Jersey before
            briefly playing for Duke University. He was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the No. 1 pick in the
            2011 NBA Draft, and in 2016, he teamed with LeBron James to give the Cavaliers their first championship in
            franchise history. Along with his dazzling scoring ability, Irving is known for his "Uncle Drew" commercials
            and his controversial comments about the Earth being flat. After six years in Cleveland, Irving began a new
            phase of his NBA career in 2017 as a member of the Boston Celtics.
          </p>
          <h2>Joining the Boston Celtics</h2>
          <p>
            After six seasons, four All-Star appearances and an NBA championship as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers,
            Kyrie Irving embarked on the next phase of his career with the Boston Celtics in 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things got off to a less-than-ideal start: On October 17, five minutes into the season opener, fellow
            Celtics newcomer Gordon Hayward went down with a fractured tibia. On November 11, Irving suffered a minor
            facial fracture, and he returned to action a few days later wearing a stifling mask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the setbacks, the Celtics ripped off a 16-game win streak from late October to just before
            Thanksgiving. With Irving showcasing his clutch scoring ability, along with a commitment to playing
            energetic defense under coach Brad Stevens, the Celtics became a favorite to win the NBA's Eastern
            Conference.
          </p>
          <h2>Kyrie Irving’s Stats</h2>
          <p>
            Nominally a point guard, the 6'3" Irving scores well more than the "pass first"-type players who
            traditionally man the position. He averaged an impressive 25.2 points per game during the 2016-17 NBA
            season, and 21.6 points per game overall during his six seasons with the Cavaliers. He set a career high
            with 57 points in a win over the San Antonio Spurs in March 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Irving averaged a middling 5.5 assists per game with the Cavaliers, topping out with a career-best 14
            assists vs. the Minnesota Timberwolves in February 2017. He set a career high with seven steals earlier in
            the season, vs. the Golden State Warriors in December.
          </p>
          <p>
            An excellent free-throw shooter, Irving converted 87.3 percent of his attempts with the Cavaliers. He made a
            solid 38.3 percent of his attempts from three-point range during those years, including a career-best 41.5
            percent in 2014-15.
